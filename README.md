# TVCTestFeed
Test data to feed the TVC on the test stand for a hot fire. We wanted small changes as to not break the linkages, or drastically change the thrust direction.
This code also waits for 10 seconds from initial power up before looping through the test feed, to allow time to get back to the launch control at a safe distance and ignite the F-10 motor
